Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm
Key Features:
Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS): Adjusts CPU speed based on workload to reduce power consumption.
Task Prioritization: Schedules tasks based on energy efficiency, balancing performance and power usage.
Idle State Optimization: Puts the CPU in low-power states when idle to save energy.
Adaptive Scheduling: Uses machine learning or heuristics to predict and optimize CPU usage.
Fairness and Performance Balance: Ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining performance.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: C/C++, Python
Operating System: Linux (for kernel-level modifications or simulations)
Tools & Libraries: SimSo (for simulation), MATLAB (for analysis), NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
Machine Learning (Optional): TensorFlow/PyTorch for predictive scheduling models
How to Use:
Setup the Environment: Install required dependencies like GCC (for C), Python libraries, or simulation tools.
Configure Scheduling Policies: Define energy-efficient scheduling parameters.
Run Simulations or Implement in OS Kernel: Test the algorithm using workload scenarios.
Analyze Results: Compare power consumption, task completion time, and CPU utilization.
Workflow:
Task Arrival: Processes/tasks arrive in the CPU queue.
Workload Analysis: System analyzes task priority and estimated execution time.
Energy-Aware Scheduling:
Adjusts CPU frequency dynamically.
Schedules tasks based on energy efficiency policies.
Execution & Monitoring:
